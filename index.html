        <h3>Learning & the love of it!</h3>
        <p>Recently, the learning aspect of life has been tarnished publically and socially. Young adults after finishing High School aren't
           interested in finding new skills, or at least don't put as much effort in finding them anymore. I personally love
           learning things at my own pace and discovering new pillars of life, even if they are small.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Programming is a Skill that I've always thought-of as being useful and something that can fit the needs of many people and me!
           Right now more than ever it's essential to have good-looking Websites, and that's why I'm learning
           many languages related to that.</p>
